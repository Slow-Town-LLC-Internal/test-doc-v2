/**
 * API Specification Collection Script
 * 
 * This script will be implemented in Phase 3 to:
 * 1. Read the list of API sources from config/sources.json
 * 2. For each source, fetch the OpenAPI specification file
 * 3. Validate the specification format
 * 4. Convert YAML to JSON if needed
 * 5. Save the processed specification to public/api-specs/
 *
 * GitHub Actions will run this script to keep the API documentation up to date.

console.log('For now, we are using manually created API specifications for testing.');

// Future implementation will go here in Phase 3
